In the file "CHICAGO_ANALYSIS_MIGUEL_SILVA.ipynb" are the answers to both questions
The main.py file include an API.
The model is uploaded [here](https://we.tl/t-h9ufmHkTUJ) because this normally could have been in an S3 bucket.
The Dockerfile is an attempt to dockerize the API for production use (kubernetes)
There are a lot of things missing, like logs and ETL process, that could not be done because of time constraints.
